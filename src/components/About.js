          Hi, I'm Jonathan—a recent Computer Science graduate from Sacramento State University with a passion for building innovative software solutions. During my studies, 
          I got hands-on experience in full-stack development and system analysis, particularly through my senior project where I built an e-commerce platform from scratch. 
          That project taught me how to design user-friendly interfaces, optimize database performance, and implement secure authentication.

        <p className="ml-6 text-lg lg:text-lg pt-4">
        In the past, I also worked as a substitute paraprofessional, assisting students and collaborating with teachers. 
        Since many teachers were not tech-savvy and most schools required students to use laptops, 
        I gained experience troubleshooting computer issues and navigating technology. 
        This role not only sharpened my technical troubleshooting skills but also improved my ability to communicate complex concepts in a clear, approachable way.
        </p>
        <p className="ml-6 text-lg lg:text-lg pt-4">
          In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and continuously learning through personal projects. 
          I’m excited to bring my technical skills and collaborative spirit to a professional environment where I can contribute to creating high-quality, accessible solutions.
